# Quick Parcel App 🚀 [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/parcel-app.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parcel-app) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com) </br>

Parcel (like Webpack) allows you to create React projects (and bundle different things such as images, files etc). With Parcel you don't need to configure anything - everything is configured for you. Also, Parcel follows a very strong and strict philosophy: "Be fast, be simple" (yeah, they don't say that in their website, but it's obvious). So, Quick Parcel App (this project) allows you to create a React application without configuring anything.

-   [Main Website](https://parcelapp.netlify.com/) - How to create a new app.

-   [Parcel Documentation](https://parceljs.org/) - Do you want to know more about Parcel?

-   [React Documentation](https://es.reactjs.org/) - You don't know anything about react?

If something doesn't work please create a new [issue](https://github.com/karttofer/parcel-app/issues/new).

## `npm start` or `yarn start`

You can run the project just writing these command, we want to make easier how you crate your application. If you run the command and change something the project will realod with the new changes.

The actual direction of your project will be: [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234/).

## `npm test` or `yarn test`

Run the project in testing mode. Whit this, you can create your testing and watch the changes in real-time.

We only have one testing for the App.js component, so this will be the first test that you will see.

## Thanks!

This is a new open-source project, we want to create something new and amazing for Parcel, if you want you can support it or share it, that can help us a lot.
